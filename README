Hello friend!

I'm really happy that you're reading this.
Wait no more and let us proceed to the installation process.


INTRODUCTION
============
pKiLL is a program that I've created which can be used to end/restart unresponsive applications in linux. The GUI helps to achieve this with ease. Try it youself.

1.	Run the install.sh to install necessary dependencies for the smooth functioning of the application.

2.	After the installation:
	python3 pKiLL.py


Enjoy using the app.


Please ket me know your views on the application.
Thank you.
